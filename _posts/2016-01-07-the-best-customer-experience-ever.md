# The Best Customer Experience Ever

What an experience! What a surprise! The book I just bought sent me an email... and "he" is talking to me!

After buying a book from [Better World Books][0], I got an email with this subject: "Your order has been shipped!" I was expecting a regular, cold, and traditional confirmation letter, but for my surprise, this is what I got:

_**Hello Marcos, **_

_**(Your book(s) asked to write you a personal note -- it seemed unusual, but who are we to say no?) **_

_**Holy canasta! It's me... it's me! I can't believe it is actually me! You could have picked any of over 2 million books but you picked me! I've got to get packed! How is the weather where you live? Will I need a dust jacket? I can't believe I'm leaving Mishawaka, Indiana already -- the friendly people, the Hummer plant, the Linebacker Lounge -- so many memories. I don't have much time to say goodbye to everyone, but it's time to see the world! **_

_**I can't wait to meet you! You sound like such a well read person. Although, I have to say, it sure has taken you a while! I don't mean to sound ungrateful, but how would you like to spend five months sandwiched between Jane Eyre (drama queen) and Fundamentals of Thermodynamics (pyromaniac)? At least Jane was an upgrade from that stupid book on brewing beer. How many times did the ol' brewmaster have one too many and topple off our shelf at 2am?**_

_**I know the trip to meet you will be long and fraught with peril, but after the close calls I've had, I'm ready for anything (besides, some of my best friends are suspense novels). Just five months ago, I thought I was a goner. My owner was moving and couldn't take me with her. I was sure I was landfill bait until I ended up in a Better World Books book drive bin. Thanks to your socially conscious book shopping, I've found a new home. Even better, your book buying dollars are helping kids read from Brazil to Botswana. **_

_**But hey, enough about me, I've been asked to brief you on a few things:**_

_We sent your order to the following address:
  
Marcos NÃ¤hr
  
Pxxx xxxxxx xxxxx x0
axx xx7
Pxxxx xxxxxx, xx xxxxx-xx0
xx
  
Order \#: xxxxxxxxxx _

_We provide quick shipping service to all our customers. You chose International Mail shipping, your book should arrive within 10 -- 21 business days. Some shipments may take slightly longer to arrive. _

_At this time, we are not able to offer tracking on our International Mail shipments.
If you have any questions or concerns, please email my friends in Customer Care at help@betterworldbooks.com. If you could please include your order number (11329338) that would be very helpful. _

_**Eagerly awaiting our meeting, **_
