# Measure what Matters

Telling a manager to measure what matters is asking to advising dieters to watch their weight.
It's almost too obvious to mention. Yet competing approaches proliferate much like diet plans. 

While desired results such as service excellence, effective teamwork, or productivity come only to those willing to step on the scales, finding the right way to keep score in organizations has proven elusive. Despite an abundance of advice, confusion persists and performance suffers.

> Efforts to find the right way to keep score have been management's version of the search for the Holy Grail ~Joan Magretta

The dilemma is illustrated by the story of a man in a hot air balloon who, upon realizing that he was lost, reduced altitude and spotted a woman below.

_He descended a bit more and shouted:   
"**Excuse me, can you help me? I promised a friend I would meet him an hour ago, but I don't know where I am.**" _

_The woman called up:
  
"**You are in a hot air balloon hovering approximately thirty feet above the ground. You are between 40 and 41 degrees north latitude and between 82 and 83 degrees west longitude.**" _

_"**You must be an engineer**" responded the balloonist. _

_"**I am**," replied the woman, "**how did you know**?" _

_"**Well**," answered the balloonist, "**everything you told me is technically correct, but I have no idea what to make of your information, and the fact is I am still lost. Frankly you've not been much help so far.**" _

_The woman below retorted, "**You must be in management.**" _

_"**I am**," replied the balloonist, "**but how did you know?**" _

_"**Well," said the woman, "you don't know where you are or where you are going. You have risen to where you are due to a large volume of hot air. You made a promise that you have no idea how to keep, and you expect people beneath you to solve your problems. The fact is, you are in exactly the same position you were before we met, but now; somehow, it's my fault.**"_

## Defining What Matters

Measurement in most organizations is a mess. We err in every conceivable way. We measure too much or too little. We make measures incomprehensibly complex or overly simplistic. Our measures are too often lopsided and unbalanced. There is a pressing need for a commonsense framework for measurement, a way to measure what matters. ironically, the things that matter most are readily apparent.
