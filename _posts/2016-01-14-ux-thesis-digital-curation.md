### UX thesis digital curation

> Curation has a distinguished history in cultural institutions.

In galleries and museums, curators use judgment and a refined sense of style to select and arrange art to create a narrative, evoke a response, and communicate a message. As the digital landscape becomes increasingly complex, and as businesses become ever more comfortable using the web to bring their product and audience closer, the techniques and principles of museum curatorship can inform how we create online experiences---particularly when we approach content.

Bloggers can also be considered as curators and experts of a particular subject, hand-picking others' assets around a particular theme or topic and then layering in their own distinct voice.

When a site launches, your audience arrives to learn more about what you know most about. It's critical to create a content experience with purpose, that is consistent and contextual. This helps to assert your brand's authority, establishes relationships with your audience, and secures a return visit based on your content's value. The content strategist-as-curator is the one who makes this happen.
