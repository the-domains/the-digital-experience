# Invisible Design

##### Even in a medium made up primarily of texts, graphic language is necessary. It is responsible for the perfect communication between message content and its audience.

The several building stages of a visual image have, for some time now, been studied by psychologists, and their opinion is unanimous: sight is not a perception based on inertia, a reception of external objects and forms imposing themselves collectively onto passive visual cells.

> Such syn-aesthetic subliminal communication which reaches our eyes through colors, types, graphic shapes and styles may be called invisible design.

The system which captures photons is undoubtedly necessary, but it is not enough to convey a picture of what is around us. To complete the process, there has to be brain activity turning implicit information into explicit data, an operation converting electrical discharges into coherent images.

Objects and forms do not reach us as such, they are recognized and reconstructed by our brain, equipped as it is with the ability to analyze, synthesize and rank. It is not the eyes, but the brain that sees.

But how does the brain build an image, the image of what it believes to be there though it actually isn't?

It seems two stages are involved in that process. On the one hand, there is a symbolical interpretation evolving into ever more complex levels; on the other, there is a comparison to what is perceived as reality.

An overall image is built in consecutive stages towards more comprehensive levels of integration, which then provide a full visual image.

An impression, symbolization, a comparison, a perception, and new symbolizations in an ever growing degree of complexity. These are the main stages of brain activity involved in image creation. In this collective integration, the whole is more significant than its constituent parts.

Our sight implies operations of analysis, recognition, and reintegration to a well-known setting.

Such synaesthetic subliminal communication which reaches our eyes through colors, types, graphic shapes and styles may be called invisible design.

That blatantly graphic language of invisible design can be considered one of the main integral components in building and relaying messages.

That is exactly why, in a medium made up primarily of texts, graphic language is necessary. It is responsible for the perfect communication between message content and its audience.
