# The biological GPS

We use basic strategies to guide us in space... and we do the same when navigating websites. 

When it comes to navigation performance, there are many theories stating what is right and what is wrong. But before we make any decisions regarding navigation performance in digital interfaces, it is important to understand how our brain works when the issue at hand is spatial localization.

Human beings possess the ability to situate themselves in space. It works like a biological positioning device -- a GPS (Global Positioning System) -- except it features a capital advantage: our ability does not stop working in case part of the direction system fails because of the several tasks it performs. 

We possess a complex cognitive system which employs three basic strategies to guide us in space: orientation, trajectory integration and course follow-up. They may be used at the same time or not. 

**Orientation**  
"Look over there. Do you see that gray building with blue windows? Go that way; the Post Office is on the ground floor". According to neurologists, "orientation" is the strategy people use to guide themselves via an easily noticeable point of reference. 

**Trajectory Integration**  
"Do you remember how you got here? Then go back to the bakery and turn right. Walk two blocks to the Post Office". In the strategy called "trajectory integration", the brain recreates individual stretches of the way in a cumulative progress report which takes into consideration the recollection of our own movements. 

In trajectory integration, the cognitive memory is the one utilized the least. It deals only with some general instructions and with the so-called direction vector. Trajectory integration works because it is based primarily on the knowledge of the movement's general direction. 

**Course Follow-up **"Go ahead on Bourbon Street; turn left on Toulouse, then right on Chartres and walk up to the middle of the block". This strategy, called "course follow-up", employs references such as names of streets and buildings, besides instructions on how to get to in-between points. 

It is much more accurate than orientation or trajectory integration, but in course follow-up, any detail you forget might give you problems in getting to your destination. All the points of reference and midway directions must be remembered. It is the most thorough system and, therefore, the most reliable, but it may fail due to ordinary memory lapses. Course follow-up is usually a challenge to the brain.  

Our cognitive system's three basic strategies above are also put to use in virtual environments. As you move along (navigate) a website or graphic interface, the brain gathers information on such environment -- colors, shapes, sounds, lighting, movements, sensations of time going by, etc. -- in order to determine the route taken. 

The part of our brain controlling direction is called by neurobiologists "cognitive map". That map is essentially metaphorical, and looks more like a hierarchical frame of connections, in which positions and distances are relative, than like an actual map. That is so because we tend to memorize only what is necessary. 

The cognitive maps we use are similar to a graph, a set of dots and connections -- much like a subway map. The dots represent the several references, and the connections between them correspond to the actions that take us from one point to the next. Like a subway map, accurate distances and precise angles are unnecessary. Our mental map provides only the approximate proportions between individual stretches and directions, and displays the dots according to the connection between them. 

For a website's good navigation performance, it is essential to provide several forms of localization -- navigation bars, menus, breadcrumbs, site maps, descriptive links, and so on -- and let the users themselves choose which strategy to use when creating their mental maps.
